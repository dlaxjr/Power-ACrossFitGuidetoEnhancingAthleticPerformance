# Chapter 4: Power Across Domains

CrossFit trains power across domains [6]:
- **Short (0–2 min)**: Snatch (981 W), wrestling takedowns (1103.6 W) prioritize muscle [17].
- **Medium (5–15 min)**: "Fran" (450 W), 400m sprints (500 W) balance strength-speed [21].
- **Long (20+ min)**: 5K row (250 W), soccer matches use leanness [29].

A 2025 study shows CrossFit’s multi-domain training improves power endurance by 10–12% in youth [36]. Coaches can program short WODs for wrestlers, medium circuits for basketball, and long conditioning for soccer/running [9].
