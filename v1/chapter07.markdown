# Chapter 7: 8-Week CrossFit Program for School Athletes

This 3-on, 1-off program (5 days/week) progresses from strength to power:

## Weeks 1–2: Foundation Phase
**Goal**: Build muscle, assess body fat [19].

**Day 1:**
- **Warm-Up**: 3 rounds (10 air squats, 10 push-ups, 5 pull-ups, 5 min) [10].
- **Strength**: Back Squat, 5x5 at 70% 1RM [20].
- **WOD**: 10-min AMRAP: 5 power cleans (60% 1RM), 10 box jumps (24"/20"), 15 double-unders [27].
- **Cool-Down**: 5 min stretches.

## Progression and Monitoring
Increase weights 2.5–5% weekly [22]. Target 5–10% fat reduction via high-protein diets (1.6–2.2 g/kg body weight) [19]. Hinshaw’s 2025 advice: "Muscle sets the foundation; leanness unlocks speed" [31].
