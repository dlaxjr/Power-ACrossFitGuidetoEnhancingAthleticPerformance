# Chapter 6: Strength and Velocity in CrossFit: Advanced Models

The force-velocity curve optimizes power [3]:
- **High Force, Low Velocity**: Deadlift (200 kg, 0.2 m/s) builds muscle [32].
- **Low Force, High Velocity**: Double-unders (~2 m/s) use leanness [33].
- **Optimal Power**: Snatch (60 kg, 1.5 m/s) balances both.

Peak power at 60â€“70% 1RM yields 20% gains in youth [35]. VBT ensures bar speed above 0.8 m/s, with lean athletes maintaining 735.75 W vs. 681.17 W under fatigue [5]. A 2024 study adds that neural adaptations from CrossFit increase firing rates by 25% [36].
