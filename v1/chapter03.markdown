# Chapter 3: The Physics of Power: Mathematical Foundations

Power is work rate:
\[
P = \frac{W}{t}
\]
Where:
- $P$: Power (watts, W)
- $W$: Work (joules, J)
- $t$: Time (seconds, s)

Work is:
\[
W = F \times d
\]
Where:
- $F$: Force (newtons, N)
- $d$: Distance (meters, m)

Thus:
\[
P = \frac{F \times d}{t}
\]
With velocity $v = d / t$:
\[
P = F \times v
\]
This blueprint guides programming: muscle boosts force (e.g., squat 1RM from 120 kg to 130 kg), fat reduction enhances velocity (e.g., 15% to 10% body fat) [32, 33]. A 2025 study shows optimizing power at 60% 1RM yields 20% higher outputs in youth [35].

## Expanded Examples
### Snatch (CrossFit)
- Strength: 70 kg (686 N)
- Distance: 1.8 m
- Time: 1.5 s
- Work: $686 \, \text{N} \times 1.8 \, \text{m} = 1234.8 \, \text{J}$
- Power: $1234.8 \, \text{J} / 1.5 \, \text{s} = 823.2 \, \text{W}$; at 1.2 s $\to 1029 \, \text{W}$

Application: Muscle drives force for track throwers; leanness speeds execution [25].

### Box Jump (CrossFit)
- Strength: 75 kg athlete (735.75 N)
- Distance: 0.6 m
- Time: 0.5 s
- Work: $735.75 \, \text{N} \times 0.6 \, \text{m} = 441.45 \, \text{J}$
- Power: $441.45 \, \text{J} / 0.5 \, \text{s} = 882.9 \, \text{W}$; at 0.4 s $\to 1103.6 \, \text{W}$

Application: Fat reduction enhances jump speed for basketball [30].
