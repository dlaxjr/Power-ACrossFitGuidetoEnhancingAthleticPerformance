# Chapter 10: Training for Running: Building Power Endurance

Running (400m–5K) requires 250–500 W, blending muscle force and lean velocity [29]. CrossFit aligns with Hinshaw’s 2025 aerobic capacity model [31].

## Energy Systems and Physiology
- **Glycolytic (10 s–2 min)**: 400m (500 W), Type IIa fibers [26].
- **Oxidative (2+ min)**: 5K (250 W), Type I fibers [29].

Muscle aids hill runs; 5–10% fat reduction boosts VO2 max by 6–8% [19]. A 2024 study shows aerobic training with strength lifts improves endurance by 10% [37].

## Hinshaw’s 2025 Running Protocols
Hinshaw emphasizes: "Muscle powers through fatigue; leanness sustains speed" [31]. Workout:
- **Tempo Run**: 5 × 800m at 85% effort, 75 s rest.
- **Goal**: Sustain 350 W, enhance aerobic base.

Pair with WODs like 400m runs and kettlebell swings [6].

## Practical Application
- **Strength**: 4x5 front squats at 75% 1RM [22].
- **Conditioning**: 12 × 200m at 80% effort, 1 min rest [21].
- **WOD**: 4 rounds: 400m run, 15 kettlebell swings (24/16 kg), 10 pull-ups.

Target 6–10% improvement in 1-mile times [25]. Use 50–60% carb diets [19].
