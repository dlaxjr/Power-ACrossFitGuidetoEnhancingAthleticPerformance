# Chapter 9: Sprinting: Maximizing Power for Speed

Sprinting generates 1500–2500 W, driven by muscle and leanness [21]. CrossFit’s lifts and velocity drills are ideal. Hinshaw’s 2025 insight: "Sprinting demands power endurance—muscle for explosive starts, leanness for sustained speed, and aerobic recovery" [31].

## Biomechanics and Energy Systems
The ATP-PC system fuels 0–10 s sprints via Type IIx fibers [26]. A 10% fat reduction cuts 100m times by 0.5–1 s [33]. CrossFit’s cleans and sprints boost stride force; HIIT improves firing rates by 20% [36].

## Hinshaw’s 2025 Sprint Protocols
Hinshaw’s latest protocol enhances recovery [31]:
- **Workout**: 10 × 100m at 90% effort, 90 s rest.
- **Goal**: Sustain 1500 W, improve aerobic recovery.

Integrate with WODs pairing sprints and snatches [21].

## Practical Application
- **Strength**: 5x3 power cleans at 65% 1RM [32].
- **Velocity**: 8 × 30m hill sprints [33].
- **WOD**: 5 rounds: 5 power snatches (60% 1RM), 10 burpees, 50m sprint.

Track 40-yard dash, aiming for 8–12% improvement [28].
